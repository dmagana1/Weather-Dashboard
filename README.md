In this project they wanted us to create Weather Dashboard that would allow the user to search for city of there choice, and see the current weather and the next 5 day forecast. This project was harder than I excepted, but after Googling and Youtubing my questions I was able to create the script and connect the API to script page and create the website.

https://github.com/dmagana1/Weather-Dashboard/blob/master/pic1.JPG - This was my first attempt! I couldnt figure out how to get the 5-day forecast to show at the bottom, but after taking a small rest I went back and looked at my code and was able to figure it I was small a piece of code. 

Now my porjecty look like this []https://github.com/dmagana1/Weather-Dashboard/blob/master/pic2.JPG

# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
